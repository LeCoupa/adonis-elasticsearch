# Adonis Elastic Search

This service provider makes it easier to integrate and to work with [the official Elasticsearch client library](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js) for Node.js

It is built on top of @elastic/elasticsearch and proxies all the methods keeping them 100% original. So you can follow official [Elasticsearch API reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/api-reference.html).

## Installation

```
npm install @poweredwith/adonis-elasticsearch
```

## Set the environment variable

Make sure you set the `ES_URL` environment variable in your .env file. This will be used to access your Elasticsearch server.

```javascript
ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
```

## Registering the provider

Make sure to register the provider inside `start/app.js` file.

```js
const providers = ["@lecoupa/adonis-elasticsearch/providers/ElasticProvider"];
```

That's all! Now you can use the provider by pulling it from IoC container

```js
const Elastic = use("Elastic");

const response = await Elastic.search({
  index: "my-index",
  body: {
    query: {
      match_all: {},
    },
  },
});
```
